# The Golden Rule and Confucian Ethics: A Comparative Study

A comparative analysis of the "Golden Rule" in the Christian tradition and the principles of benevolence in Confucian philosophy.

## 📖 Biblical Perspective
The "Golden Rule" is a fundamental ethical principle found in the teachings of Jesus during the Sermon on the Mount.

* **Source:** [Matthew 7:12](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/MAT.7.12)
* **The Command:** "So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you."
* **Nature:** This is a **proactive** and **positive** command. It requires the individual to take the initiative in performing acts of kindness and service.
* **Scope:** It is presented as the summary of "the Law and the Prophets."

## 🏛️ Confucian Perspective: The Two Sides of Ren (仁/Benevolence)
Confucianism approaches this ethical standard from both a restrictive (negative) and an expansive (positive) angle.

### The Silver Rule (Shu - 恕)
* **Proverb:** **己所不欲，勿施于人** (What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others).
* **Focus:** Restraint and avoidance of harm. It sets the baseline for human decency by ensuring one does not inflict suffering.

### The Positive Standard (Zhong - 忠)
* **Proverb:** **己欲立而立人，己欲达而达人** (If you wish to be established, help others to be established; if you wish to be successful, help others to be successful).
* **Focus:** Proactive empathy. Just like [Matthew 7:12](https://www.bible.com/bible/111/MAT.7.12), it uses **"己欲"** (one's own desires) as the measuring stick for active benevolence.

## 🌏 Methodology of Love
Confucianism provides a specific social framework for how these rules should be applied in daily life.

### The Extension of Love
* **Proverb:** **老吾老 以及人之老，幼吾幼 以及人之幼** (Treat with respect the elders in my family, then extend that to the elders of others; treat with love the young in my family, then extend that to the young of others).
* **Concept:** Known as **"Graduated Love,"** this teaches that empathy starts with the family unit and ripples outward to the rest of society.
