### Key Observations
* **Spanish (NBLA):** In the [NBLA version](https://www.bible.com/bible/103/PHP.4.NBLA) of [Philippians 4:6](https://www.bible.com/bible/103/PHP.4.NBLA), **"afanosos"** is the specific state of mind that believers are instructed to avoid.
* **Greek Source:** Both the Spanish and English versions are translating the Greek command ***merimnate*** ($μεριμνᾶτε$), which emphasizes that anxiety "divides" your focus away from peace.
* **Cross-Cultural Imagery:** Different languages describe the same internal feeling through varied physical metaphors: a **thicket** (Hebrew), a **choke** (English), a **weighted heart** (Chinese), and a **fever** (Japanese).
