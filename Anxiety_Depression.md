Normalizing for income reduces but does not eliminate disparities.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Higher income provides less mental health protection for Black and Hispanic individuals than for White individuals due to structural racism.
* **Chronic Burden:** Minority populations often face more [chronic and debilitating](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/any-anxiety-disorder) forms of these conditions regardless of wealth.

## 6. Neurology: Structure vs. Function
**Question:** What are the physical differences in the brain for those with anxiety or depression? Are these differences the causes or the results?

* **Structure:** Depression often results in **hippocampus shrinkage**, while anxiety is linked to **amygdala expansion**.
* **Connectivity:** There is often [weakened communication](https://marylandneuromuscular.com/neurology-and-mental-health-how-stress-affects-brain-function/) between the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala.
* **The Cycle:** Differences are both **causes** (genetic/trauma vulnerability) and **results** (damage from chronic cortisol exposure).

---

## 7. Genetics and Heritability
**Question:** Is anxiety or depression genetic?

* **Heritability:** Anxiety is estimated to be 30%–40% heritable. Family history increases risk significantly.
